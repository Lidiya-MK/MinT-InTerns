# MinT-InTerns
This system is an internship application management and intern's project management system for Ministry of Innovation and Technology. It is designed to fully digitize the internship application management process which was previously manual as well as gain a better oversight of the dozens of intern software projects the institution manages in each internship Cohort.
As shown in the screenshots below, it provides detailed reports on the progress and success/failure of each project under a particular cohort. It provides supervisors with features to manage intern accounts as well as track projects' progress. Interns can form teams on the system under the supervision of a supervisor and create a personalized WBS (Work BreakDown Structure) for their project. This will ensure members of each project stay aligned with their project's objectives throughout the duration of the cohort. It will also provide a more transparent approach to track contibutions of each members to the project at hand.
